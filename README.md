# VanLife

## Introduction

#### This prototype is a training project aimed at practicing React Router concepts. 
It serves as a platform for individuals interested in van rental, allowing them to either rent a van or offer their own van for rent. 
This project includes a fake server implemented using Mirage.js. The fake server provides simulated API endpoints for testing and development purposes.

The project includes a simulated login system that grants users access to their host homepage, providing an overview of their ongoing rentals. 
Renters can utilize a search engine with filters to find vans that match their preferences. 

It's important to note that this version focuses on implementing React Router and does not include full authentication functionality.
